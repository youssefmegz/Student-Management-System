# Student Management System

This project is a simple **Student Management System** built using **C programming**. It allows for the dynamic management of student records using linked lists and implements essential operations like adding, updating, and deleting student data. The project was developed as part of my learning journey in **embedded systems** and focuses on data structures, memory management, and algorithm design.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Insert a new student record with details such as name, ID, and grades.
- **Update Student**: Modify existing student records.
- **Delete Student**: Remove student records from the system.
- **Display Students**: Show a list of all student records.
- **Search Student**: Find a specific student by ID.

## Key Learning Points

1. **Data Structures**: The core of the project revolves around using **linked lists** to manage student records dynamically.
2. **Memory Management**: Efficient use of memory through dynamic allocation and proper deallocation to prevent memory leaks.
3. **Algorithm Design**: Implementation of key algorithms to handle data efficiently, focusing on operations like adding, updating, deleting, and searching.
4. **Scalability**: The system is designed to handle increasing data without significant loss in performance.
